# Study goals

- Intercalibrate size selectivity and catchability between two survey vessels
  based on paired fishing operations.

- Use a log-Gaussian Cox process to model counts

- Account for overdispersion, aggregation, and dependence among size classes

- Look at two hake species off the coast of Namibia

# Notation

## Indices

- $i$: station index
- $j$: vessel index
- $k$: length group

---

## Observed quantities

$N_{ijk}$: number of fish at station $i$ caught by vessel $j$ in size group $k$

$A_{ij}$: Area swept at station $i$ by vessel $j$

---

## Latent quantities

$\Phi_{ik}$: abundance of size class $k$ at station $i$

$R_{ijk}$: haul-specific variation

$S_{jk}$: selectivity of vessel $j$ on size class $k$

???

Note that $\Phi_{ik}$ is shared between vessels

---

## Statistical model

$$N_{ijk} \mid \Phi, R, S \sim \operatorname{Poisson}(A_{ij} \exp(\Phi_{ik} + R_{ijk} + S_{jk}))$$

- Allows for overdispersion
- Allows for correlation structure
- $\Phi_{ik} + R_{ijk} + S_{jk}$ is normally-distributed, making this a
  log-Gaussian Cox process (LGCP)

---

## The selectivity term

Constraint:

$$S_{1k} = -S_{2k}$$

- no base gear
- symmetric variance

Selectivity ratio (disregarding $R$):

$$\exp(2S_{1k}) = \frac{\mathbb{E}[N_{i1k} / A_{i1} \mid \Phi, S]}{\mathbb{E}[N_{i1k} / A_{i1} \mid \Phi, S]}$$

---

## The selectivity term

Model as a random walk across size classes

$$S_{11} \sim \operatorname{normal}(0, \sigma^{2}_{1})$$

$$S_{1(k + 1)} \mid S_{1k} \sim
  \operatorname{normal}(S_{1k}, \sigma_{S}^{2}) \quad \text{for}\ k = 1,\ldots,K-1$$
               

---

## The size distribution

$$\Phi_{i1} \sim \operatorname{normal}(0, \sigma_{1}^{2})$$

$$\Phi_{i(k + 1)} \mid \Phi_{ik} \sim \operatorname{normal}(\Phi_{ik}, \sigma_{\Phi}^{2})$$

The choice to use $\sigma_{1}^{2} = 10$ and unconstrained random walks here and
for selectivity is interesting.

???

- random walks produce a *continuous* function, so you don't need to worry about
  binning your length data!

- 95% prior mass of Poisson rates for age class 1 would be $`r exp(qnorm(0.025, 0, 10))`$ to $`r exp(qnorm(0.975, 0, 10))`$

---

## The "nugget" effect

Could represent variation due to aggregations.
Allows for overdispersion.

$$R_{ijk} = R_{ijk}^{AR} + R_{ijk}^{WN}$$

$$R_{ijk}^{WN} \sim \operatorname{normal}(0, \sigma^{2}_{WN})$$

$$R_{ijk}^{AR} \mid R_{ij(k - 1)}^{AR},\rho \sim \operatorname{normal}(\rho R_{ij(k - 1)}^{AR}, \sigma^{2}_{AR})$$

???

- Nugget could be variance due to abundance (as proposed here), or catchability.
- Not possible to attribute.

Note that:
- density is correlated among size classes at a given station
- selectivity is correlated among size classes for a given vessel
- nugget is correlated among size classes for a given station *and* vessel

# Implementation

- Maximum likelihood

- Coded in TMB

- Random effects $\Phi$, $R$, and $S$ marginalized out using Laplace approximation

- Verified through simulation

- Some issues estimating variance components

# Case study

.pull-left[
Namibian hake trawl surveys

- 1990-2000: R/V Dr. Fridtjof Nansen
- 1998- : F/V Blue Sea
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/namibia_survey_stations.png", dpi = 175)
```
]

---

## Results

- F/V Blue sea is more efficient at catching large size hake

- F/V Blue Sea less efficient at catching small *M. paradoxus*

- Small *M.capensis* selectivity similar

- More variation in *M. paradoxus* among size classes

- Possible that more variance is place on the nugget for *M. capensis*

---

## Results

AIC preferred separate curves for the two species.

## Results

The autoregressive component in $R$ was also included.

# Discussion

- Can this be extended to the unpaired-tow case?

- Extending $\Phi$ into space could allow intercalibration of selectivity among
  survey and fishery vessels.

- This would be computationally much more involved.
