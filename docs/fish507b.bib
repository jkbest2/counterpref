  abstract = {The Hawaiian deep-slope (75\textendash 400\,m) Deep7 bottomfish fishery consists of seven (i.e., six snappers and one grouper) species. This study developed a sampling survey and modeling methodology for estimating biomass for this complex in the Main Hawaiian Islands. The island-wide fishery-independent sampling survey using two gears (commercial fishers with hook-and-line, 3D stereo camera) was conducted to generate estimates of relative abundance- and biomass-at-length for the complex. A length-based modeling approach was applied to the opakapaka fishery and survey size-structured abundance data, life history demography, and total fishery catches to estimate a feasible range of effective sampling area for the standard survey gear (i.e., cameras). These sampling area estimates were then used to expand survey estimates of relative biomass to population total biomass. The longer-term focus of this effort is to improve stock assessments of the Deep7 complex. The survey and modeling methods developed in this study provide the underpinnings of an integrated information and modeling system for assessment that enables multiple levels of comparison and validation with respect to data sources (fishery-dependent and fishery-independent) and modeling approaches (biomass-dynamic and cohort-structured).},

  abstract = {Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from the diverse fields of computer science and computational science to create a new approach to numerical computing. Julia is designed to be easy and fast. Julia questions notions generally held as "laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical computing: 1. High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. 2. One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment, and 3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left untouched as they are built by the experts. We introduce the Julia programming language and its design --- a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that one can have machine performance without sacrificing human convenience.},

  abstract = {Standardization of commercial catch and effort data is important in fisheries where standardized abundance indices based on fishery-dependent data are a fundamental input to stock assessments. The goal of the standardization is then to minimize bias due to the confounding of apparent abundance patterns with fishing power. There is a high risk of confounding between fishing power and abundance in fisheries where the fleet has altered their fishing technology over the years. Also, the spatial aspects and the fishing history can be so heterogeneous that any standardization really involves an extrapolation, for example to a hypothetical standard vessel. When the standardization involves an extrapolation, then the appropriate modeling strategy is to build a so-called estimation model, rather than a predictive model. Strategies to build such an estimation model from fishery-dependent data include: pay careful attention to subject matter, and collect information about potential confounding effects to include in the model (putting a high value on the acquisition of data on covariates); model variable catchability at a highly disaggregated scale; aim for realistic coefficients when fitting the model and pay relatively less attention to achieving precision or maximizing explained variance; adopt modern statistical methods to combine data from different sources; and if data are deficient, then apply precautionary allowances. These strategies offer some protection against bias due to confounding, in the absence of formal criteria for identifying the best model.},

While the use of more advanced statistical methods has helped catch rates to be standardised against many explanatory variables, the changing spatial characteristics of most fisheries data sets provide additional challenges for constructing reliable indices of stock abundance. After reviewing the use of general linear models to construct indices of annual stock abundance, potential biases which can arise due to the unequal and changing nature of the spatial distribution of fishing effort are examined and illustrated through the analysis of simulated data. Finally, some options are suggested for modelling catch rates in unfished strata and for accounting for the uncertainties in the stock and fishery dynamics which arise in the interpretation of spatially varying catch rate data.},

The form of the relationship is usually not known and not well determined by the data, and equally good model fits can often be obtained with different plausible specifications of selectivity.

  abstract = {1.Population surveys are often used to estimate the density, abundance, or distribution of natural populations. Recently, model-based approaches to analyzing survey data have become popular because one can more readily accommodate departures from pre-planned survey routes and construct more detailed maps than one can with design-based procedures. 2.Spatial models for population distributions (SMPDs) often make the implicit assumption that locations chosen for sampling and animal abundance at those locations are conditionally independent given modelled covariates. However, this assumption may be violated when survey effort is non-randomized, leading to preferential sampling. 3.We develop a hierarchical statistical modelling framework for detecting and alleviating the biasing effects of preferential sampling in spatial distribution models fitted to count data. The approach works by specifying a joint model for population density and the locations selected for sampling, and specifying a dependent correlation structure between the two processes. 4.Using simulation, we show that moderate levels of preferential sampling can lead to large (e.g. 40\%) bias in estimates of animal density and that our modelling approach can considerably reduce this bias. In contrast, preferential sampling did not appear to bias inferences about parameters informing species\textendash habitat relationships (i.e. slope parameters). 5.We apply our approach to aerial survey counts of bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) in the eastern Bering Sea. As expected, models with a preferential sampling effect led to lower abundance than those without. However, several lines of reasoning (better predictive performance, higher biological realism) led us to prefer models without a preferential sampling effect for this dataset. 6.When population surveys break from traditional scientific survey design principles, ecologists should recognize the potentially biasing effects of preferential sampling when estimating population density or occurrence. Joint models, such as those described in this paper, can be used to test and correct for such biases. However, such models can be unstable; ultimately the best way to avoid preferential sampling bias is to incorporate design-based principles such as randomization and/or systematic sampling into survey design.},

Trawl surveys seldom allow absolute estimates of fish population sizes but, if appropriately located, timed, and designed, can provide a broad range of information about catchable fish species and the ecosystem that supports them. This information may be more conducive to sustainable management of fisheries than the traditional focus on the abundances of selected stocks. The paper first briefly proposes how survey-based methods might supplement existing fishery-dependent stock assessments, as would be necessary during a transition phase to a more ecosystem-orientated system of management. Full survey-based management is then considered in relation to management objectives, the selection of indicators, survey design, reference periods, levels and directions, statistical aspects, CPUE-based assessments, and management responses to good and bad signals from the ecosystem. We argue that existing fishery-dependent stock assessments cannot be claimed to produce absolute estimates of stock abundance and fishing mortality because natural mortality (M) is seldom known accurately and, therefore, that they should not be presumed superior to the relative information from surveys, and an agreeable form of adaptive management.},

However, the cost-benefit of fishery-independent monitoring is rarely explicitly assessed. Development of an integrated fishery model for the Torres Strait tropical rock lobster (TRL) Panulirus ornatus fishery provided the opportunity to assess the relative value of different combinations of fishery survey methods. Annual fishery-independent pre-season and midseason surveys were compared with fishery-dependent data collection. All three methods are currently carried out or have been in place in the recent past. Typically, short-lived highly variable species such as TRL require both recruit and spawner biomass surveys. Using CPUE data only, and not carrying out either the pre-or mid season fishery independent surveys, resulted in lower and considerably less precise TAC estimates. When conducting both fishery-independent surveys a positive cost benefit ratio was realised if additional catch to the CPUE-based TAC estimate was greater than 14.8 t (around 2\% of TAC). TAC estimates based on independent fishery surveys were up to 20\% greater than the model-predicted estimates using CPUE data alone. Including both independent fishery surveys returned a positive net present value over a 20 year timeframe even when randomly varying biomass, accounting for increasing survey costs, lower gross margins, and lower lobster prices.},

Preferential sampling arises when the process that determines the data locations and the process being modelled are stochastically dependent. Conventional geostatistical methods assume, if only implicitly, that sampling is non-preferential. However, these methods are often used in situations where sampling is likely to be preferential. For example, in mineral exploration, samples may be concentrated in areas that are thought likely to yield high grade ore. We give a general expression for the likelihood function of preferentially sampled geostatistical data and describe how this can be evaluated approximately by using Monte Carlo methods. We present a model for preferential sampling and demonstrate through simulated examples that ignoring preferential sampling can lead to misleading inferences. We describe an application of the model to a set of biomonitoring data from Galicia, northern Spain, in which making allowance for preferential sampling materially changes the results of the analysis.},

  abstract = {Preferential sampling in geostatistics occurs when the locations at which observations are made may depend on the spatial process that underlines the correlation structure of the measurements. If ignored, this may affect the parameter estimates of the model and the resulting spatial predictions. In this thesis, we first show that previously proposed Monte Carlo estimates for the likelihood function may not be approximating the desired function. Furthermore, we argue that for preferential sampling of moderate complexity, alternative and widely available numerical methods to approximate the likelihood function produce better results than Monte Carlo methods. We illustrate our findings on various data sets, include the biomonitoring Galicia dataset analysed previously in the literature.  Research on preferential sampling has so far been restricted to stationary sampling locations such as monitoring sites. In this thesis, we also expand the methodology for applicability in cases where the sensors are moving through the domain of interest. More specifically, we propose a flexible framework for inference on preferentially sampled fields, where the process that generates the sampling locations is stochastic and moving through a 2-dimensional space. The main application of these methods is the sampling of ocean temperature fields by marine mammal mounted sensors. This is an area of research which has grown drastically over the past 25 years and is providing scientists with a wealth of new oceanographic information in areas of our oceans previously not well understood.  We show that standard geostatistical models may not be reliable for this type of data, due to the possibility that the regions visited by the animals may depend on the ocean temperatures, hence resulting in a type of preferential sampling. Our simulation studies confirm that predictions obtained from the preferential sampling model are more reliable when this phenomenon is present, and they compare very well to the standard ones when there is no preferential sampling. We apply our methods to sea surface temperature data collected by Southern elephant seals in the Southern Indian ocean and show how predictions of sea surface temperature fields using this data may vary when accounting for the preferential movement.},

This local repulsion can be caused by the researcher in charge of collecting data who, after observing the stochastic process of interest in a specific location, avoids collecting new samples near this place. Proceeding in this way, the resulting sampling design would in practice include a repulsion window centered on each sampling location, even though the researcher was planning the sample preferentially. This perturbation in the Geostatistical model under preferential sampling can be modeled through a discrete nonhomogeneous stochastic process over a partition composed of M subregions of the study area, where only one sample lies in each subregion. Simulations and an application to real data are performed under the Bayesian approach and the effects of this perturbation on estimation and prediction are then discussed. The results obtained corroborate the idea that the proposed methodology corrects the distortions caused by this perturbation, thus mitigating the effects on inference and spatial prediction.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are now being widely used in ecology for management and conservation purposes across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. The increasing interest in SDMs has drawn the attention of ecologists to spatial models and, in particular, to geostatistical models, which are used to associate observations of species occurrence or abundance with environmental covariates in a finite number of locations in order to predict where (and how much of) a species is likely to be present in unsampled locations. Standard geostatistical methodology assumes that the choice of sampling locations is independent of the values of the variable of interest. However, in natural environments, due to practical limitations related to time and financial constraints, this theoretical assumption is often violated. In fact, data commonly derive from opportunistic sampling (e.g., whale or bird watching), in which observers tend to look for a specific species in areas where they expect to find it. These are examples of what is referred to as preferential sampling, which can lead to biased predictions of the distribution of the species. The aim of this study is to discuss a SDM that addresses this problem and that it is more computationally efficient than existing MCMC methods. From a statistical point of view, we interpret the data as a marked point pattern, where the sampling locations form a point pattern and the measurements taken in those locations (i.e., species abundance or occurrence) are the associated marks. Inference and prediction of species distribution is performed using a Bayesian approach, and integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) methodology and software are used for model fitting to minimize the computational burden. We show that abundance is highly overestimated at low abundance locations when preferential sampling effects not accounted for, in both a simulated example and a practical application using fishery data. This highlights that ecologists should be aware of the potential bias resulting from preferential sampling and account for it in a model when a survey is based on non-randomized and/or non-systematic sampling.},

  abstract = {To estimate absolute abundance from research trawl surveys, the catchability of the fish to the gear must be known or estimated. Using 47 data sets of length-specific catchability, we conducted a hierarchical Bayesian metaanalysis of length-specific catchability for a number of different species groups. It was found that the Bayesian estimates of catchability were seldom near or above 1 for any species or size. This suggests that any assumption that swept-area abundance estimates are in fact absolute abundance would likely underestimate the true abundance. Catchability was higher for haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) than for Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) of the same size, suggesting behavioural differences between these two species. We found a seasonal difference in catchability with higher catchability for surveys in summer\textendash fall than for those in spring\textendash winter. The results of this study can be applied both for the reconstruction of fish community structure for ecosystem models and as auxiliary (or prior) information for single-species stock assessment where catchability is estimated within the stock assessment procedure.},

  abstract = {Statistical models supporting inferences about species occurrence patterns in relation to environmental gradients are fundamental to ecology and conservation biology. A common implicit assumption is that the sampling design is ignorable and does not need to be formally accounted for in analyses. The analyst assumes data are representative of the desired population and statistical modeling proceeds. However, if data sets from probability and non-probability surveys are combined or unequal selection probabilities are used, the design may be non-ignorable. We outline the use of pseudo-maximum likelihood estimation for site-occupancy models to account for such non-ignorable survey designs. This estimation method accounts for the survey design by properly weighting the pseudo-likelihood equation. In our empirical example, legacy and newer randomly selected locations were surveyed for bats to bridge a historic statewide effort with an ongoing nationwide program. We provide a worked example using bat acoustic detection/non-detection data and show how analysts can diagnose whether their design is ignorable. Using simulations we assessed whether our approach is viable for modeling data sets composed of sites contributed outside of a probability design. Pseudo-maximum likelihood estimates differed from the usual maximum likelihood occupancy estimates for some bat species. Using simulations we show the maximum likelihood estimator of species\textendash environment relationships with non-ignorable sampling designs was biased, whereas the pseudo-likelihood estimator was design unbiased. However, in our simulation study the designs composed of a large proportion of legacy or non-probability sites resulted in estimation issues for standard errors. These issues were likely a result of highly variable weights confounded by small sample sizes (5\% or 10\% sampling intensity and four revisits). Aggregating data sets from multiple sources logically supports larger sample sizes and potentially increases spatial extents for statistical inferences. Our results suggest that ignoring the mechanism for how locations were selected for data collection (e.g., the sampling design) could result in erroneous model-based conclusions. Therefore, in order to ensure robust and defensible recommendations for evidence-based conservation decision-making, the survey design information in addition to the data themselves must be available for analysts. Details for constructing the weights used in estimation and code for implementation are provided.},

Model constraints included a fixed natural mortality rate and age- and gear-specific but time-invariant catchabilities. Trawl catchability decreased with age, whereas gillnet catchability increased towards a maximum by age-4. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate how the information content of the different data sets influenced parameter estimates. Estimated catchability values were relatively robust to changes in data weighting. Estimated gillnet catchability values were fairly consistent with those derived from more conventional methods. An additional mortality term was added to reflect double-crested cormorant ( Phalacrocorax auritus ) predation, and vulnerabilities associated with angling and cormorants were calculated using independent length frequency information. Estimated subadult mortality increased and the influence of fishing mortality slightly decreased during recent years when double-crested cormorants were abundant and more restrictive size limits were in place. Walleye density in Oneida Lake (New York, USA) in the last decade is estimated to be approximately half of that before 1990.},

Many citizen science projects have the flexibility for participants to select where they survey, resulting in more participants, but also spatially biased data. It is important to assess the extent to which these spatially biased data can provide reliable estimates of species distributions. Here we quantify the extent of site selection bias in a citizen science project and the implications of this spatial bias in species distribution models. Using data from the BirdTrack citizen science project in Great Britain from 2007 to 2011, we modelled the spatial bias of data submissions. We next produced species occupancy models for 138 bird species, and assessed the impact of accounting for spatial bias. We compared the distributions to those produced using unbiased data from an Atlas survey from the same region and time period. Averaging across 138 species, models with spatially biased data produced accurate and precise estimates of species occupancy for most locations in Great Britain. However, these distributions were both less accurate and less precise in the Scottish Highlands, showing on average a positive bias. Accounting for the spatially biased sampling with weights led to on average greater accuracy in the Scottish Highlands, but did not increase precision. This region is both distinct in environmental characteristics and has a low density of observations, making it difficult to characterise environmental relationships with species occupancy. Accounting for the spatially biased sampling did not affect average accuracy or precision throughout most of the country. Spatially biased citizen science data can be used to estimate species occupancy in regions with stationary environmental relationships and good sampling across environmental space. The reliability of estimated species distributions from spatially biased data should be further validated and tested under a range of different scenarios.},

  abstract = {Fishery-independent surveys, such as bottom trawl surveys, provide time-series abundance estimates, which inform many modern stock assessments. Area-swept biomass estimates from trawl surveys assume that fish densities do not differ between trawlable (T) and untrawlable (UT) areas. Bias and imprecision in the biomass estimates can occur when this assumption is not met. Thus, reliable estimates are needed for both the extent of T and UT habitat types in the surveyed area, and the relative densities of the fish species in the two habitat types to accurately assess groundfish populations. Acoustics and stereo-camera survey tools were used in the present study to determine the extent of T and UT habitat within 25-km2 bottom trawl survey grid cells historically designated as T/UT. Splitbeam acoustics were used to compare the abundance of rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) be\- tween the T/UT grid cell areas. Acoustic data were collected along uniformly spaced transects within 52 T and 43 UT grid cells throughout the Gulf of Alaska during summers 2013, 2015, and 2017. The acoustic backscatter attributed to rockfishes in UT grid cells was approximately three times that in T cells, and the percentages available to the bottom trawl survey were 40 \% for harlequin rockfish, 43 \% for northern rockfish, 51 \% for dusky rockfish, and 98 \% for Pacific ocean perch (POP). These findings allowed for estimation of the trawl catchability coefficient (q; a scaler between estimates of the area-swept survey abundance and actual abundance) of 0.46 for harlequin rockfish, 0.50 for northern rockfish, and 0.64 for dusky rockfish, and 1.15 for POP. These values could be used to inform the relationship between trawl survey estimated and actual abundances of rockfishes to improve the accuracy of stock assessments for these species.},

One way to accomplish this task formulates an observed sequence data likelihood exploiting a coalescent model for the sampled individuals' genealogy and then integrating over all possible genealogies via Monte Carlo or, less efficiently, by conditioning on one genealogy estimated from the sequence data. However, when analyzing sequences sampled serially through time, current methods implicitly assume either that sampling times are fixed deterministically by the data collection protocol or that their distribution does not depend on the size of the population. Through simulation, we first show that, when sampling times do probabilistically depend on effective population size, estimation methods may be systematically biased. To correct for this deficiency, we propose a new model that explicitly accounts for preferential sampling by modeling the sampling times as an inhomogeneous Poisson process dependent on effective population size. We demonstrate that in the presence of preferential sampling our new model not only reduces bias, but also improves estimation precision. Finally, we compare the performance of the currently used phylodynamic methods with our proposed model through clinically-relevant, seasonal human influenza examples.},

  abstract = {Selectivity studies have found applications in a wide range of topics within fishery science, such as fishery management, stock assessment, and ecological process studies. However, obtaining selectivity functions can often be a difficult and costly endeavor. Because of this difficulty, many studies are limited to the comparison of catch from two fishing gears, where relative differences in catch efficiency are often presented in the form of catch comparison rate or catch ratio. Studies of these rates are well known to often improve commercial fisheries, which benefit from highly selective gears. However, utility of these statistics for the purposes of fisheries surveys and stock assessment is not very well understood. In this study we adapted methods previously used for catch ratio to obtain length-dependent selectivity ratio function for two survey gears. Selectivity ratio can be obtained when area-swept or volume-swept fish density estimates are available from both gears. In other cases it is possible to obtain relative selectivity ratio. We present a general approach to obtain selectivity ratio in survey gear comparison studies and model it using three alternative techniques (linear and smooth mixed effect, and beta-regression). We use crossvalidation to choose between alternative models. We present examples of practical application of selectivity ratio with three case studies: a comparison of fine-and large mesh bottom trawls used in Arctic surveys, a study testing an assumption of non-selectivity of the Nephrops bottom trawl for snow crab in the Bering Sea, and a comparison of two survey midwater trawls for pollock in the Bering Sea. We show that selectivity ratio statistics can be used as a generalization of selectivity studies, where one gear is non-selective, as well as in catch comparison studies where selectivity of both gears is unknown.},

AIV is an important output from surveys and is commonly used in formal assessments of survey quality, in survey comparison studies, and in stock assessments. However, uncertainty in AIV estimates is poorly understood and studies on the precision and bias in survey AIV estimates are lacking. Typically, AIV estimates are ``design based'' and are derived from sampling theory under some aspect of randomized samples. Inference on population density in these cases can be confounded by unaccounted process errors such as those due to variable sampling efficiency (q). Here, we simulated fish distribution and surveys to assess the effect of q and variance in q on design-based estimates of AIV. Simulation results show that the bias and precision of AIV depend on the mean q and variance in q. We conclude that to fully evaluate the reliability of AI, both observation error and variability in q must be accounted for when estimating AIV. A decrease in mean q and an increase in the variance in q results in increased bias and decreased precision in survey AIV estimates. These effects are likely small in surveys with mean q {$\geq$} 1. However, for surveys where q {$\leq$} 0.5, these effects can be large. Regardless of the survey type, AIV estimates can be improved with knowledge of q and variance in q.},

Such standardization is particularly important for highly migratory species (e.g., tunas, pelagic sharks, and billfishes), because of time-varying mismatches between distributions of abundance and the distribution of fishing effort. Two commonly applied methods for standardizing CPUE are generalized linear models (GLMs), which can account for changes in fishing practices in a straightforward linear fashion, and habitat-based standardizations (e.g., statHBS), which use nonlinear analysis to relate the distribution of fishing effort to the species distribution. We evaluated the accuracy of these methods over three patterns in vertical catchability as related to ocean temperature profiles, and 50 possible biomass trajectories using a simulation framework that followed the general effort dynamics of the Japanese longline fishery in the Atlantic Ocean from 1956 to 2009. Additionally, we propose a method for directly incorporating vertical habitat information into the linear models. Overall, we found the most accurate approach to be a delta-lognormal GLM with our unique habitat factor. The statHBS approach was the most accurate when catchability was simulated to peak in surface waters. However, statHBS was much more sensitive to errors in estimates of longline hook depths (i.e., habitats exploited). Based on these results, we recommend that relative abundance be estimated for highly migratory species following a delta-GLM approach that considers vertical habitats fished.},

  abstract = {A conditional maximum likelihood model is used to estimate the size-selectivity of trawls, gillnets, and hooks when the data are obtained by simultaneous fishing with meshes or hooks of different size and/or shape. Size-selectivity is expressed here by the selection curve, r(l), the probability that a fish of length l, if contacting the gear, will be retained (caught). In many selectivity studies r(l) is fitted either by eye, by heuristic means, or by improper application of generalized linear models. Then it is not possible to make legitimate statistical inference about r(l), or about assessments of the state of the fishery if those assessments use r(l). It is shown here that by conditioning on the total catch, selectivity data can be modeled as binary data, or polytomous data on interval scales. Application of the model to trawl and hook data demonstrates that selection curves can be fitted using generalized linear models, which may require nonstandard link functions or link functions with parameters.},

  abstract = {The incidental capture, or bycatch, of loggerhead sea turtles Caretta caretta in commercial fishing gear is considered a significant threat to their recovery. Bycatch analyses that use fishery-dependent data only reflect the spatial and temporal co-occurrence of turtles and fishing effort and therefore do not directly reveal conditions associated with turtle distributions. Fishery-independent and -dependent data can be used together to identify environmental conditions associated with turtle presence and the subsequent risk of a bycatch encounter if fishing effort is present. We developed generalized additive models (GAMs) to describe fishery-independent encounter rates of loggerheads observed in aerial and resource surveys in the US mid-Atlantic region as a function of environmental variables. We then fit a fishery-independent GAM to fishery-dependent data collected from commercial gillnet, bottom trawl, and scallop dredge fisheries in the mid-Atlantic region, and tested the model on new fishery-dependent data to assess how well the model predicted bycatch events. The preferred model describes fishery-independent encounter rates as a function of latitude, sea-surface temperature, depth, and salinity. When this model was fit to fishery-dependent data and tested on new data, it predicted 85\% of the observed bycatch events when grouped by latitude and season, although it underestimated bycatch events in southern latitudes in winter. We identify times and areas of elevated bycatch risk on which to focus future conservation efforts and observer coverage.},

This information is valuable input for modelling species interactions in the southern Benguela ecosystem. In the present study, a method is described for mapping the density distribution of 15 key species: anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus, sardine Sardinops sagax, round herring Etrumeus whiteheadi, chub mackerel Scomber japonicus, horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus capensis, lanternfish Lampanyctodes hectoris, lightfish Maurolicus muelleri, albacore Thunnus alalunga, bigeye tuna Thunnus obesus, yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares, silver kob Argyrosomus inodorus, snoek Thyrsites atun, Cape hake Merluccius spp., kingklip Genypterus capensis and chokka squid Loligo vulgaris reynaudi. The purpose was to make use of all available sources of data to extend the spatial and temporal coverage of the southern Benguela. Six sources of data were combined on a 10\textasciiacute{} \texttimes{} 10\textasciiacute{} cell grid in a Geographical Information System: acoustic and demersal surveys conducted by Marine and Coastal Management (MCM), and pelagic, demersal (including midwater trawl), hake-directed and tuna-directed longline commercial landings data collected by MCM. Comparisons of distributions between two periods (1980s and 1990s) and between two semesters (April \textendash September and October\textendash March) were conducted, but biases as a result of major differences in sampling strategy prevented detailed analysis for certain species. Maps of density distributions are nevertheless presented here and the method to determine them is discussed.Afr. J. mar. Sci. 26: 115\textendash 139},

In response, we developed a spatial dynamic factor analysis (SDFA) model that decomposes covariation in multispecies catch rates into components representing spatial variation and fishing behavior. SDFA estimates spatiotemporal variation in fish density for multiple species and accounts for fisher behavior at large spatial scales (i.e., choice of fishing location) while controlling for fisher behavior at fine spatial scales (e.g., daily timing of fishing activity). We first use a multispecies simulation experiment to show that SDFA decreases bias in abundance indices relative to ignoring spatial adjustments and fishing tactics.

This special issue includes ten submissions that highlight potential benefits arising from spatio-temporal index standardization including: (1) improved prediction for areas with little-to-no data; (2) capacity to weight densities by area to account for sampling rates that vary spatially; (3) calculation of the composition (e.g. age or length) of the indices and to weight predictions by catch to inform the composition of fishery removals, (4) estimation of distribution shifts and range expansion/contraction; and (5) capacity to combine data sources. The articles in this Special Issue highlight the need for continued development and testing for spatio-temporal index standardization methods, so that the relative strengths and weaknesses of different approaches are fully understood.

  abstract = {Interpretation of fishery-dependent and independent-survey data requires accounting for changes in the proportion of local individuals that are caught by fishing gear (``catchability''). Catchability may be influenced by measured characteristics of fishing gear, and even standardized fishing techniques may experience changing catchability over time due to changes in fishing vessel characteristics and personnel. The importance of vessel power has long been recognized in the analysis of fishery dependent catch per unit effort data, but less-studied in the analysis of fishery independent data collected by research vessel surveys. Here we demonstrate how differences in catchability among vessels (``vessel effects''), as well as random variation in vessel-specific catchability over time (``vessel-year effects'') can be incorporated into generalized linear mixed models through their treatment as random effects. We apply these methods to data for 28 groundfish species caught in a standardized survey using contracted fishery vessels and personnel in the Northeast Pacific. Model selection shows that vessel, vessel-year, and both effects simultaneously are supported by available data for at least a few species. However, vessel-year effects generally have a larger effect on catch rates than vessel-effects and hence abundance indices estimated using both vessel- and vessel-year effects are generally similar to estimates when using just vessel-year effects. Additionally, models indicate little support for the hypothesis that characteristics such as length and displacement of the contracted vessels used in this survey have a substantial impact on catch rates. Finally, inclusion of vessel- or vessel-year effects generally results in wider estimates of credible intervals for resulting indices of abundance. This increased credible interval width is consistent with statistical theory, because vessel effects will result in non-independence of different sampling occasions, thus decreasing effective sample sizes. For this reason, we advocate that future analyses include vessel- and/or vessel-year effects when standardizing survey data from cooperative research programs.},

  abstract = {We present a statistical method for intercalibration of fishery surveys methods, i.e. determining the difference in catchability and size selectivity of two methods, such as trawl gears or vessels, based on data from paired fishing operations. The model estimates the selectivity ratios in each length class by modelling the size distribution of the underlying population at each station and the size-structured clustering of fish at small temporal and spatial scales. The model allows for overdispersion and correlation between catch counts in neighbouring size classes. This is obtained by assuming Poisson-distributed catch numbers conditional on unobserved log-Gaussian variables, i.e. the catch is modelled using log-Gaussian Cox processes. We apply the method to catches of hake (Merluccius paradoxus and M. capensis) in 341 paired trawl hauls performed by two different vessels, viz. the RV Dr Fridtjof Nansen and the FV Blue Sea, operating off the coast of Namibia. The results demonstrate that it is feasible to estimate the selectivity ratio in each size class, and to test statistically the hypothesis that the selectivity is independent of size or species. For the specific case, we find that differences between size classes and species are statistically significant.},

  abstract = {Measuring fishing effort is one important element for effective management of recreational fisheries. Traditional intensive angler intercept survey methods collect many observations on a few water bodies per year to produce highly accurate estimates of fishing effort. However, scaling up this approach to understand landscapes with many systems, such as lake districts, is problematic. In these situations, spatially extensive sampling might be preferable to the traditional intensive sampling method. Here we validate a model-based approach that uses a smaller number of observations collected using multiple methods from many fishing sites to estimate total fishing effort across a fisheries landscape. We distributed on-site and aerial observations of fishing effort across 44 lakes in Vilas County, Wisconsin and then used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to account for seasonal and daily trends as well as lake-specific differences in mean fishing effort. Estimates of total summer fishing effort predicted by GLMMs were on average within 11 \% of those produced by traditional mean expansion. These estimates required less sampling effort per lake and can be produced for many more lakes per year. In spite of the higher uncertainty associated with model-based estimates from fewer observations, the improvements associated with the addition of only three aerial observations per lake highlighted the potential for improved precision with relatively few additional observations. Thus, the combination of GLMMs and extensive data collection from multiple sources could be used to estimate fishing effort in regions where intensive data collection for all fishing sites is infeasible, such as lake-rich landscapes. By using these methods of extensive data collection and model-based analysis, managers can produce frequently updated assessments of system states, which are important in developing proactive and dynamic management policies.},

Behavioral responses were quantified and analyzed to evaluate predictions related to fish behavior, orientation, and capture. Individuals showed 3 different initial responses independent of fish size, gait, and fish density: they swam close to (75\%), were herded away from (19\%), or moved vertically away from (6\%) the seabed. Individuals primarily swam in the direction of initial orientation. No fish were oriented against the trawling direction. Fish in the center of the trawl mouth tended to swim along the bottom in the trawling direction. Only individuals that were stimulated to leave the bottom were caught. Individuals in peripheral locations within the trawl mouth more often swam inward and upward. Fish that swam inward were twice as likely to be caught. Fish size, gait, and fish density did not influence the probability of capture. A trawl that stimulates yellowtail flounder to orient inward and leave the bottom would increase the efficiency of a trawl.},

  year = {2018},
  month = sep,
  abstract = {This paper presents a general model framework for detecting the preferential sampling of environmental monitors recording an environmental process across space and/or time. This is achieved by considering the joint distribution of an environmental process with a site-selection process that considers where and when sites are placed to measure the process. The environmental process may be spatial, temporal or spatio-temporal in nature. By sharing random effects between the two processes, the joint model is able to establish whether site placement was stochastically dependent of the environmental process under study. Furthermore, if stochastic dependence is identified between the two processes, then inferences about the probability distribution of the spatio-temporal process will change, as will predictions made of the process across space and time. The embedding into a spatio-temporal framework also allows for the modelling of the dynamic site-selection process itself. Real-world factors affecting both the size and location of the network can be easily modelled and quantified. The general framework developed in this paper is designed to be easily and quickly fit using the R-INLA package. We apply this framework to a case study involving particulate air pollution over the UK where a major reduction in the size of a monitoring network through time occurred. It is demonstrated that a significant response-biased reduction in the air quality monitoring network occurred. We also show that the network was consistently unrepresentative of the levels of particulate matter seen across much of Great Britain throughout the operating life of the network. This may have led to a severe over-reporting of the levels across much of Great Britain.},

  abstract = {Size-at-age information is critical in estimating growth parameters (e.g., the von Bertalanffy growth function [VBGF]) that are used to assess fish populations. Due to gear selectivity, single sampling methods rarely sample all ages or all sizes equally well. Most growth estimates rely on samples from a single gear or a haphazard combination of gears, potentially leading to biased and imprecise growth parameter estimates. We evaluated the efficacy of combining samples from two gears with different size selectivity to estimate VBGF parameters; we then applied that approach to a case study on the Lochloosa Lake (Florida) population of Black Crappies Pomoxis nigromaculatus. Simulated age- and size-structured populations were randomly sampled with two gears characterized by different size-selectivity curves (one gear was selective for smaller fish; the other was selective for larger fish). Maximum likelihood VBGF estimates obtained for each gear separately were compared with estimates from a combined VBGF fitted to data from both gears. In every simulated scenario, a combined-gear approach reduced bias and increased precision for estimating the VBGF, but the gear-specific proportions that improved VBGF estimates depended on size selectivity. The VBGF estimates for the Black Crappie population showed that the combined-gear method yielded intermediate parameter values relative to single-gear approaches based on (1) trawl sampling (fishery-independent survey) and (2) angler harvest (as determined from carcass collections; fishery-dependent data). Furthermore, the combined-gear approach had greater precision in individual parameter estimates and much less variance than single-gear approaches when estimating the VBGF. Combining data from two gears can increase sample representativeness, leading to improvements in VBGF estimation. Such approaches can reduce uncertainty in VBGF estimation and can provide insight into key demographic processes occurring in fish populations for which ontogeny and gear selectivity lead to imperfect sampling.Received January 22, 2015; accepted July 30, 2015},

  abstract = {Fish and wildlife often exhibit an aggregated distribution pattern, whereas local abundance changes constantly due to movement. Estimating population density or size and survey detectability (i.e. gear efficiency in a fishery) for such elusive species is technically challenging. We extend abundance and detectability (N-mixture) methods to deal with this difficult situation, particularly for application to fish populations where gear efficiency is almost never equal to one. The method involves a mixture of statistical models (negative binomial, Poisson, and binomial functions) at two spatial scales: between-cell and within-cell. The innovation in this approach is to use more than one fishing gear with different efficiencies to simultaneously catch (sample) the same population in each cell at the same time-step. We carried out computer simulations on a range of scenarios and estimated the relevant parameters using a Bayesian technique. We then applied the method to a demersal fish species, tiger flathead, to demonstrate its utility. Simulation results indicated that the models can disentangle the confounding parameters in gear efficiency and abundance, and the accuracy generally increases as sample size increases. A joint negative binomial\textendash Poisson model using multiple gears gives the best fit to tiger flathead catch data, while a single gear yields unrealistic results. This cross-sampling method can evaluate gear efficiency cost effectively using existing fishery catch data or survey data. More importantly, it provides a means for estimating gear efficiency for gear types (e.g. gillnets, traps, hook and line, etc.) that are extremely difficult to study using field experiments.},
